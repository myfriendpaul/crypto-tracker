## Overview

**Cryptonite** 

_[Cryptonite]_(https://cryptonite-16c40.web.app/) is a remake of another project I have. Due to time constraints previously dealt with, I decided to rebuild it from the ground up. The application still uses React for the frontend, but I went ahead and utilized Firebase this time around for database management and authentication. User is able to search, add, and remove from their watchlist. When accessing a single cryptocurrency, data is displayed on a graph depending on the user's selected timeframe of 24hrs, 30 days, 3 months, or 1 year. Chart.js was used to populate graphical data.  _
